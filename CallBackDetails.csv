Callback,Description
EarlyStopping,Stops training if validation loss does not improve for 20 epochs to prevent overfitting.
ModelCheckpoint,Saves the best model (based on validation loss) to 'best_model.h5'.
TensorBoard,Logs training/validation metrics and model architecture to TensorBoard.
ReduceLROnPlateau,"Reduces learning rate by 0.2 if validation loss does not improve for 10 epochs, with a minimum of 1e-6."
CSVLogger,Logs training/validation metrics to 'training.log' CSV file.
LearningRateScheduler,Reduces learning rate by 0.9 every 10 epochs during training.
